// APP IDEA
// The concept is a student-to-student delivery app designed to streamline campus life by connecting students who need items delivered with those who are available to make the deliveries. Many students live far from key locations on campus, such as dining halls, package centers, or libraries, and often struggle to find time to pick up food, packages, or other essentials between classes, studying, and extracurriculars. This app would allow students to request deliveries from their peers—whether it’s grabbing a meal from the dining hall, picking up a package from the mailroom, or even delivering study materials. On the flip side, students who have free time can sign up as delivery runners, earning money while helping their peers. This not only saves time for busy students but also creates a flexible earning opportunity for others, enabling them to focus on their studies or other priorities. By fostering a sense of community and mutual support, the app would make campus life more efficient and connected, all while addressing a real need in a simple, scalable way.
